              <p>Come on, let your colours burst. I can feel this light that's inside of me. All night they're playing, your song. From Tokyo to Mexico, to Rio. Thereâ€™s no going back. But down to earth. Magical, colorful, Mr. Mystery, ee. Different DNA, they don't understand you.</p>
              <p class="mb-0">But down to earth. She's got that, je ne sais quoi, you know it. I can see the writing on the wall. The boys break their necks try'na to creep a little sneak peek. Take me, ta-ta-take me. Open up your heart. Thought that I was the exception. Boom, boom, boom. Venice beach and Palm Springs, summertime is everything. Bring the beat back. (This is how we do)</p>
