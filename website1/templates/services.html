            Come on, let your colours burst. I can feel this light that's inside
            of me. All night they're playing, your song. From Tokyo to Mexico,
            to Rio. Thereâ€™s no going back. But down to earth. Magical, colorful,
            Mr. Mystery, ee. Different DNA, they don't understand you.
